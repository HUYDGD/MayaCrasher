# MayaCrasher

Maya is frozen and you want to save the project? This tool is for you.

This tool asks you to CTRL+Click on the frozen maya and triggers a crash.
If everything goes well (cross the fingers!), the crash handler will appear
and your project will be saved in `%TEMP%`.

This is the crash handler:

## Disclaimer

Use at your own risk, sometimes Maya is frozen so badly that when you use this
tool, it just closes without saving your project.

## How to use it

1. Download `MayaCrasher.zip` from the [Releases page](https://github.com/carpikes/MayaCrasher/releases/) (or download the source and build it by yourself)
2. Open the zip file and open MayaCrasher.exe
3. You will read `Please CTRL+Click on the Maya window that is stuck...`
4. Go back to your frozen Maya, keep the CTRL key pressed while clicking on the frozen window.
5. If everything goes well, the crash handler will appear.
